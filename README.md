# Functional programming playground

In this repo I play around with ts-belt library that delivers a functional programming paradigm for TypeScript.

## How to run

```
npm install
```

And then just use npm script like that:

```
npm run start example.ts
```

Output:

```
> start
> ts-node "./example.ts"

30
```
